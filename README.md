# ðŸ¦€ RustyChat

A chat UI for chatting with [LLMs][1], written in Rust. This uses the free [ðŸ¤— Hugging Face][2] text generation inference API. The UI was built with [Leptos][3] and [Bootstrap][4].

# Building from source

You'll need [Rust][6] and [Trunk][7]. Then just run

```sh
trunk build --release
```

to build everything. You'll find the files that need to be served in the `dist/` directory.

Or run

```sh
trunk serve
```

to start a local webserver hosting the page.
